# theroom_johnny_twitter_bot
My first twitter bot project trying to learn Python.

This twitter bot is supposed to be Johnny, from the crittically aclaimed film "The Room". He is Mark's best friend, but he wants to be your best friend too. If an other twitter user sends a sort of greeting to Johnny, he will respond with "Oh hi user_name!" 

Johnny also likes to follow trump on twitter and responds to his ridiculous tweets with "ah ha ha ha what a story trump!" 

------------

feel free to improve upon this logic! You will have to open your own twitter developer account to obtain keys neccesary to data mine twitter for your bot. I also used https://www.pythonanywhere.com to run the program online.
